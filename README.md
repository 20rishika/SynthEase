# SynthEase



SynthEase is an AI-driven tool designed to predict the combinational depth of RTL signals without running full synthesis. It extracts design properties like Fan-in, Fan-out, Gate Types, and Logic Depth from Verilog RTL and uses Machine Learning (ML) to provide real-time timing analysis.




📌 Features
✅ Parses Verilog RTL Code to extract circuit structure
✅ Computes Fan-in, Fan-out, and Combinational Depth
✅ Uses Random Forest & XGBoost models for prediction
✅ Provides API & Web-based Prediction Tool
✅ Compares ML results with actual Yosys synthesis output
✅ FastAPI and Streamlit integration for easy deployment
